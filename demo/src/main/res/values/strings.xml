    <string name="intro">This sample shows how you can use Root privilege (on rooted devices) to do something that\'s impossible on non-rooted devices.\n\n
It does it by just getting a list of files inside the protected path \"/data/\".\n\n
On non-rooted devices, it will return 0 files, and on rooted devices (given Root privilege), it should return a result of more than 0.</string>
